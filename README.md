# hello-world
My first repository.
My short story is that I need to make a career change.  Being someone who is detail oriented I am teaching myself through various websites/tutorials how to be a web developer.  I am very new at this and I am sure that I will make mistakes on the way.  Persistence and patience will be my allies in this journey.
